Introduction
=============

As stated in the project description, eclim's main goal is to bring Eclipse
functionality to the Vim editor.  Here you will find documentation on the
functionality that eclim provides.

The eclim documentation is broken up into two parts.  The first is the
comprehensive documentation which details the usage and purpose of every
command and setting.  This portion is found under the "Documentation" sub-menu
on the left.  Here you will find configuration information (<a
href="settings.html">settings</a>, <a href="mappings.html">suggested
mappings</a>, etc.), and the detailed functionality documentation which is
broken up into categories (common functionality, java development
functionality, etc.).

The second portion of the documentation consists of a set of guides which are
written to help you perform specific tasks.  These guides are located under the
"Guides" sub-menu to the left.

Before diving in, you should first familiarize yourself with the following
commands.  After that, take a look at the docs for <a
href="common/project.html">managing projects</a>.  Then feel free to move onto
the other categories.
