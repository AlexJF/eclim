      <p>
        Eclim is an <a href="http://eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> plug-in that exposes
        Eclipse functionality through a lightweight xml protocol so that other
        editors or applications can take advantage of what Eclipse has to offer.
      </p>
      <p>
        While this plug-in is not limited to any particular editor or
        application, its primary purpose is to bring Eclipse functionality to
        the <a href="http://vim.org">Vim</a> editor.

        <p>
          Sourceforge site is up!  Now it's just a matter of getting the ball
          rolling again.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm hoping to have source code navigation working by the end of next
          week.  This includes the ability to simply hit &lt;enter&gt; on a
          class name, method name, method call, etc. to jump to its declaration.
          Basically I want to replace my previous
          <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1106">vim plug-in</a>
          with the new eclipse one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before I put out any releases though, I want to have a comprehensive
          set of documentation.  For the first few releases, setup will probably
          be pretty manual, with most of it occurring through the Eclipse
          interface.  Going forward, I want to move more of that functionality
          into vim.
