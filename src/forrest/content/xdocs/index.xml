    <title>Welcome to Eclim (Eclipse integration in Vim)</title>

      <title>Overview</title>
      <p>
        The primary goal of eclim is to bring
        <a href="ext:eclipse">Eclipse</a>&trade; functionality to the Vim
        editor.  The initial goal was to provide Eclipse's java functionality in
        vim, but support for various other languages (php, python, css, html,
        xml, etc.) have been added and several more are planned.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eclim is less of an application and more of an integration of two great
        projects.  The first, <a href="ext:vim">Vim</a>, is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_wars">arguably</a> one of
        the best text editors in existence.  The second,
        <a href="ext:eclipse">Eclipse</a>, provides many great tools for
        development in various languages.  Each provides many features that can
        increase developer productivity, but both still leave something to be
        desired.  Vim lacks native Java support and many of the advanced
        features available in Eclipse. Eclipse, on the other hand, still
        requires the use of the mouse for many things, and when compared to Vim,
        provides a less than ideal interface for editing text.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is where eclim comes into play.  Instead of trying to write an IDE
        in Vim or a Vim editor in Eclipse, eclim provides an Eclipse plug-in
        that exposes Eclipse features through a server interface, and a set of
        Vim plug-ins that communicate with Eclipse over that interface (as
        illustrated below).<br/>
        <img alt="eclim diagram" src="images/diagram.gif"/>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are several benefits to this approach:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Easily migrate from using the Eclipse gui to using the lighter and
          more productive Vim interface to work on new or existing projects,
          while still having the option to open the Eclipse gui for any tasks or
          third party plug-ins not yet exposed in Vim.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spawn many instances of Vim all sharing a single background instance
          of Eclipse.
        </li>
        <li>
          Seamlessly work in a group of developers who use Eclipse, giving you
          the freedom to work in an environment that makes you most productive.
        </li>
        <li>
          Utilize the full power of Vim's scripting capabilities with support
          for running more advanced functions in the Eclipse jvm.
        </li>
      </ul>

          Eclim 1.3.6 is now available.<br/>
          One major change worth noting, is that eclim is now licensed under the
          GPLv3.  This was done to give eclim the freedom to integrate with
          other GPL projects in the future.  The documentation will remain under
          the Apache 2 license for the time being.

          <strong>Windows Users</strong>:  Eclim 1.2.0 contained a couple issues
          that can potentially prevent eclim from functioning.  A new version of

          <a href="guides/install.html#step3">installation guide</a>.  There is
          no need to download or re-install the Eclipse plugins.
        </p>

          Several new additions over the past couple weeks:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Java code completion: Integrated into Vim via Vim 7's new "User
            Defined Completion".
          </li>
          <li>
            Added eclim command line support for creating and updating projects,
            including Vim support for editing Eclipse .classpath files and
            updating Eclipse upon writing of those files.
          </li>
          <li>
            Integrated
            <a href="ext:nailgun">nailgun</a>
            to greatly improve the command line client performance.
          </li>
          <li>
            Started documenting eclim and its features.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          With the addition of these features I'm going to stop adding new
          functionality for the time being and focus on testing and ensuring that
          everything works as expected on Windows.

        <p>
          Code navigation / searching is done!  Most of the Vim integration for
          searching is done as well.  The only thing missing is viewing code for
          results that are found in a jar file that have no corresponding source
          attachment.  I may end up doing what Eclipse appears to do, which is
          to use javap to display the class and method signatures.  That or I'll
          use jad to decompile the whole source.  My only issue with jad, is
          that it is not up to date with the 1.5 byte code.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also have automated importing done as well.  The eclim server
          request just returns a list of possible results to import for a given
          request and the editor (Vim in this case) handles prompting the user
          and updating the code.
        </p>
        <note>
          The Vim integration now requires Vim 7.  Even though Vim 7 is still
          alpha, I haven't had any major issues with it and the new additions to
          the Vim scripting language are just too good to pass up.
        </note>
        <p>
          My next step is to start documenting everything and testing on a
          Windows environment to ensure there aren't any compatibility issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          After that I should be ready to put out a preliminary release.
          I'm trying to be very careful about releasing anything too soon.  The
          last thing I want it to scare anyone off with a broken project that
          doesn't seem to work properly.
        </p>

      <section id="news_2005-08-11">

          Sourceforge site is up!  Now it's just a matter of getting the ball
          rolling again.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm hoping to have source code navigation working by the end of next
          week.  This includes the ability to simply hit &lt;enter&gt; on a
          class name, method name, method call, etc. to jump to its declaration.
          Basically I want to replace my previous
          <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1106">Vim plug-in</a>
          with the new Eclipse one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before I put out any releases though, I want to have a comprehensive
          set of documentation.  For the first few releases, setup will probably
          be pretty manual, with most of it occurring through the Eclipse
          interface.  Going forward, I want to move more of that functionality
          into Vim.
