      <title>Starting eclimd</title>
      <p>
        <strong>Linux</strong>:  To start eclimd from linux, simply execute the
        eclimd script found in
        $ECLIPSE_HOME/plugins/org.eclim_<em>version</em>/bin.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Windows</strong>: The easiest way to start eclimd in windows is
        to double click on the eclimd.bat file found in
        $ECLIPSE_HOME/plugins/org.eclim_<em>version</em>/bin.
      </p>

    <section id="shutdown">
      <title>Stopping eclimd</title>
      <p>
        To cleanly shutdown eclim you should execute:
      </p>
      <source>
        $ECLIPSE_HOME/plugins/org.eclim_<em>version</em>/bin/eclim -command shutdown
      </source>
      <p>
        You can also use
        <a href="vim/index.html#ShutdownEclim">
          <strong>:ShutdownEclim</strong>
        </a>
        from any vim window which will execute the above command for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Issuing one of these commands will notify eclimd to save all the
        projects and the workspace before exiting.
      </p>
      <p>
        You could also just use Ctrl-C to kill eclimd from the console, but this
        is discouraged.  When using Ctrl-C, eclimd will not perform the
        necessary cleanup on the projects and workspace.  The result is that the
        next time eclimd is started, you will see errors from eclipse regarding
        the state of the workspace ("A workspace crash was detected.").
        Typically this isn't anything to worry about.  You should be able to use
        the proper shutdown command, and then bring eclimd back up error free.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've made several attempts to use a shutdown hook to prevent such cases,
        but the shutdown hooks always seem to disrupt eclipse's shutdown process
        resulting in threads leaking out and sticking around long after eclimd
        has exited.  I'll continue to investigate this issue, but regardless of
        the result, you should stick to using the proper shutdown command to
        ensure a clean exit.

    <section id="log">
      <title>eclimd logging</title>
      <p>
        Eclimd utilizes log4j for all of its logging.  As such, the logging can
        be configured via the
        $ECLIPSE_HOME/plugins/org.eclim_<em>version</em>/log4j.xml file.
      </p>
      <p>
        By default, eclimd writes all logging info to both the console and
        $ECLIPSE_HOME/plugins/org.eclim_<em>version</em>/log/eclimd.log.
