    <p>
      <a href="ext:maven">Maven</a> 2.x comes bundled with an Eclipse plugin
      that allows you to easily maintain your .classpath file based on your
      pom.xml.  This guide will walk you through the steps of setting this
      up for the first time and continual usage there after.
    </p>
    <note>
      For additional information on the Eclipse plugin from maven, you may visit
      their
      <a href="http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-ide-eclipse.html">
        online documentation
      </a>.

      <p>
        To initialize maven's support for updating the eclipse classpath you
        first need to set the <code>M2_REPO</code> variable in the Eclipse
        workspace by executing the following command which is made available
        when editing the pom.xml file in vim:
      </p>
      <source>
        :MvnRepo
      </source>
    </section>
    <section id="classpath">
      <title>Updating .classpath</title>
      <p>
        Once you have performed the <a href="#setup">initial setup</a>,
        updating the Eclipse <code>.classpath</code> file is as easy as
        executing the following at a command line:
      </p>
      <source>
        mvn eclipse:eclipse
      </source>
      <p>
        or in Vim:
      </p>
      <source>
        :Mvn eclipse:eclipse
      </source>
    </section>
  </body>
