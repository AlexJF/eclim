    <p>
      For linux systems, eclim ships with scripts with can be installed into
      your distribution's init.d, or equivalent.  This has the added benefit of
      allow you to run eclimd in the background and optionally start it
      automatically when your system boots up.
    </p>
    <note>
      If your distribution has an alternate means for implementing initd
      scripts, please let me know.  You may also be able to adapt the generic
      initd script for eclimd to suit your distribution.  If so, please submit
      those changes back so that other users may benefit from your work.

      <p>
        Since gentoo has their own framework for writing initd scripts, eclim
        ships with dedicated files for deployment on gentoo systems.<br/>
        To install on gentoo simply follow these steps:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Copy the file
          $ECLIPSE_HOME/plugins/org.eclim_<em>version</em>/bin/native/gentoo/etc/init.d/eclimd
          to your system's /etc/init.d directory.
        </li>
        <li>
          Copy the file
          $ECLIPSE_HOME/plugins/org.eclim_<em>version</em>/bin/native/gentoo/etc/conf.d/eclimd
          to your system's /etc/conf.d directory.
        </li>
        <li>
          Edit your new /etc/conf.d/eclimd file according to your system.  At
          the very least you will need to change the ECLIM_USER and probably the
          JAVA_HOME and ECLIPSE_HOME
        </li>
        <li>
          If you wish to have eclimd start automatically when your system boots,
          you can then add eclimd to your system's default run level:
          <source>
            $ rc-update add eclimd default
          </source>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </section>

      <title>Other Distributions</title>
      <p>
        For all other distributions, eclim includes a generic initd script,
        which can be installed as follows:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Copy the file
          $ECLIPSE_HOME/plugins/org.eclim_<em>version</em>/bin/native/linux/etc/init.d/eclimd
          to your system's /etc/init.d directory, or equivalent.
        </li>
        <li>
          Edit your new /etc/init.d/eclimd file according to your system.  At
          the very least you will need to change the ECLIM_USER and probably the
          JAVA_HOME and ECLIPSE_HOME
        </li>
        <li>
          If you wish to have eclimd start automatically when your system boots,
          you can then add eclimd to your system's default run level.  How you
          accomplish this however, is dependent upon your distribution.  Please
          see your distribution's documentation for more information, but feel
          free to notify me of that process and I can begin compiling a list
          here for other users to reference.
