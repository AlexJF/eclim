      The goal of this guide is to walk you through creating your first php
      project via eclim.

      <title>Creating a project</title>
      <p>
        The first step is to open a Vim window and create the project by
        executing:
      </p>
      <source>
        :ProjectCreate /path/to/my_project -n php
      </source>
      <p>
        The path supplied will be the path to the root of your project.  This
        path may or may not exist.  If it does not exist it will be created for
        you. When the project is created two file will be added to the root
        directory of your project, <code>.project</code> and
        <code>.projectOptions</code> At this time, the <code>.project</code>
        file is nothing that you need to worry about maintaining as it is purely
        for Eclipse.  The <code>.projectOptions</code> file on the other hand,
        is used to manage your project's dependencies, including dependencies on
        other projects and other libraries.
        For more on maintaining this file see the
        <a href="../../vim/php/includepath.html">include path docs</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you've created your project you can use the
        <strong>:ProjectList</strong> command to list the available projects and
        you should see your newly created one in the list.
      </p>
      <source>
        my_project - open   - /path/to/my_project
      </source>
      <p>
        The <strong>:ProjectList</strong> result is in the form of
        <code>projectName - (open|closed) - /project/root/path</code>.  When you
        create projects, the last path element will be used for the project
        name.  If that element contains any spaces, these will be converted to
        underscores.
