      <title>Requirements</title>
      <p>
        Before beginning the installation, first confirm that you have met the
        following requirements.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="ext:jdk_download">Java Development Kit</a> 1.5 or greater.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="ext:eclipse_download">Eclipse SDK 3.3.x</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="ext:vim_download">Vim 7.x.x</a>.<br/><br/>
          <p>
            <strong>Minimum Vim Settings</strong>: In order for eclim to
            function properly, there is a minimum set of vim options that must
            be enabled in your vimrc file (:h vimrc).
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong><code>set nocompatible</code></strong>
              <p>
                Execute :h 'compatible' for more info.  You can confirm that
                compatibliity is turned off by executing the following:
              </p>
              <source>
                :echo &amp;compatible
              </source>
              <p>
                Which should output '0'.
              </p>
              <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong><code>filetype plugin on</code></strong>
              <p>
                Execute :h filetype-plugin-on for more info.  You can confirm
                that file type plugins are enabled by executing the following:
              </p>
              <source>
                :filetype
              </source>
              <p>
                Which should output 'filetype detection:ON  plugin:ON
                indent:ON', showing at least 'ON' for 'detection' and 'plugin'.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

            <strong>Linux (and other unix based systems):</strong>
            You can start the installer by running the script you downloaded
            (note: you may have to make it executable first).
            <source>
              $ chmod 755 eclim_<em>version</em>.sh
              $ ./eclim_<em>version</em>.sh
            </source>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Windows:</strong>
            On Windows systems, simply double click the
            eclim_<em>version</em>.exe file you downloaded.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          After the installer starts up, simply follow the steps in the wizard
          to install the application.

      <p>
        Once you have finished the installation process, you can then start up
        the eclim server and verify that it is running properly.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The first step is to start the eclimd server.  To do so follow the
          directions found <a href="../eclimd.html#startup">here</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once you have started the server you can test it by opening a Vim
          window and issuing the command,
          <a href="../vim/index.html#PingEclim">
            <strong>:PingEclim</strong>
          </a>.  The result of executing this command should be
          "<code>eclim</code> <em>version</em>" echoed to the bottom of your
          Vim window.  If however, you receive
          "<code>unable to connect to eclimd - connect: Connection refused</code>",
          or something similar, then your eclimd server is not running or
          something is preventing eclim from connecting to it.  If you receive
          this or any other errors and are unsure of what steps to take,
          please feel free to visit the <a href="ext:forums">forums</a> so
          that someone can help resolve your issue.
          <br/><br/>
          <p>
            Example of successful ping:<br/>
            <img src="../images/screenshots/ping_success.png" alt="Successful Ping"/>
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
            Example of failed ping:<br/>
            <img src="../images/screenshots/ping_failed.png" alt="Failed Ping"/>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Regardless of the ping result, you can also verify your vim settings
          using the command <strong>:EclimValidate</strong>.  This will check
          various settings and options and report any problems. If all is ok
          you will receive the following message:
          <source>
            Result: OK, required settings are valid.
          </source>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="whatsnext">
      <title>What's Next</title>
      <p>
        Now that you have eclim installed, the next step is to familiarize
        yourself with at least the core set of commands that eclim
        provides, all of which are found at the index of the eclim
        <a href="../vim/index.html">documentation</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        After doing that you can then procede to create your first project:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="java/project.html">Java Project Guide</a></li>
        <!--li><a href="php/project.html">Php Project Guide</a></li!-->
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="upgrade">
      <title>Upgrading</title>
      <p>
        The upgrading procedure is the same as the installation procedure but
        there are a couple things worth noting.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The installer will remove the previous version of eclim and
          install the new one.  This includes all the files in the eclim
          eclipse plugins and the files eclim adds to your .vim or vimfiles
          directory.  So if you made any alterations to any of these files,
          be sure to back them up prior to upgrading.
        </li>
        <li>
          Since the previous version is removed any time you run the
          installer, whether upgrading or reinstalling the current version,
          you will need to always select the features you want installed
          regardless of whether they are already installed.  In a future
          version, the installer will attempt to auto select them for you.
        </li>
      </ul>
