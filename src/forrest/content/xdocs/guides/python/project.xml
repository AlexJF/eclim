      The goal of this guide is to walk you through creating your first python
      project via eclim.
    </p>
    <section id="project_create">
      <title>Creating a project</title>
      <p>
        The first step is to open a Vim window and create the project by
        executing:
      </p>
      <source>
        :ProjectCreate /path/to/my_project -n python
      </source>
      <p>
        The path supplied will be the path to the root of your project.  This
        path may or may not exist.  If it does not exist it will be created for
        you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you've created your project you can use the
        <strong>:ProjectList</strong> command to list the available projects and
        you should see your newly created one in the list.
      </p>
      <source>
        my_project - open   - /path/to/my_project
      </source>
      <p>
        The <strong>:ProjectList</strong> result is in the form of
        <code>projectName - (open|closed) - /project/root/path</code>.  When you
        create projects, the last path element will be used for the project
        name.  If that element contains any spaces, these will be converted to
        underscores.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="project_settings">
      <title>Editing project settings.</title>
      <p>
        After creating a project, the next thing you'll probably want to do is
        edit your project's settings.  To do this you can use the
        <a href="../../vim/common/project.html#ProjectSettings">
          <strong>:ProjectSettings</strong>
        </a>
        command.  If your current Vim window's
        working directory is at or under the project's root directory then you
        can execute the <strong>:ProjectSettings</strong> with no arguments,
        otherwise you will need to supply the project name.
      </p>
      <source>
        :ProjectSettings projectName
      </source>
      <p>
        After your first time editing your project's settings, a .settings
        directory will be created in the project's root directory.  In there are
        the project's preferences files.  You should avoid editing these files
        directly and stick to using <strong>:ProjectSettings</strong> to update
        them.
      </p>
      <note>
        If you have only one project or many projects that share the same
        settings you can use the
        <a href="../../vim/index.html#EclimSettings">
          <strong>:EclimSettings</strong>
        </a>
        command instead to edit the
        global settings.  These global settings will apply to any project that
        has not overridden them with values via
        <strong>:ProjectSettings</strong>.
