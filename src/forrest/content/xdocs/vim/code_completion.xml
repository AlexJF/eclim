      All the code completion functionality provided by eclim (ant, java, etc)
      makes use of the new "User Defined Completion" added to Vim 7.  To
      initiate code completion enter insert mode and type
      <em>Ctrl-X Ctrl-U</em>.  By default Vim will open a popup if there is more
      than one completion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example with java completion<br/>

    </p>
    <p>
      Once you have started the completion you can use <em>Ctrl-N</em> to
      proceed to the next match and <em>Ctrl-P</em> to move to the previous
      match.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are like me and you find those key strokes a bit cumbersome, then
      you can use the excellent <a href="ext:supertab">SuperTab</a> plugin which
      allows you to use the Tab key for completion.
    </p>
    <p>
      To find out more about Vim's insert completion execute<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>:h ins-completion</strong><br/>
      from within Vim.
