    <p>
      When saving a php source file that resides in a project, eclim will
      update that source file in Eclipse and will report any validation errors
      found.  Any errors will be placed in the current window's location list
      (:help location-list) and the corresponding lines in the source file will
      be marked via Vim's :sign functionality with '>>' markers in the left
      margin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Automatic validation of php source files can be disabled via the
      <strong>g:EclimPhpValidate</strong> variable (described below).  If
      you choose to disable automatic validation, you can still use the
      <strong>:Validate</strong> command to manually validate the current file.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Configuration</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Vim Variables:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
         <anchor id="EclimPhpValidate"/>
        <strong>g:EclimPhpValidate</strong><br/>
        If set to 0, disables source code validation.
      </li>
    </ul>
