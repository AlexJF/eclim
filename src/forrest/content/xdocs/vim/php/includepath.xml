      Source code completion, searching, and other features make use of the
      pdt's .projectOptions to locate external php resource.  When you first
      create a project, a <code>.projectOptions</code> file is created in the
      project's root directory.  If your project depends on any php files
      located outside your project or in another project, the you'll need to
      edit your .projectOptions accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      To help you do this, eclim
      provides several commands to ease the creation of new include path entries
      and variables, all of which are made available when you edit your
      .projectOptions file in vim.  Also when you write the
      <code>.projectOptions</code> file, Vim will issue a command to the eclim
      server to update the project's include path, and will report any errors
      via vim's location list (:help location-list).
    </p>
    <p>
      The following is a list of commands that eclim provides while editing your
      .projectOptions.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <anchor id="NewLibEntry"/>
        <strong>:NewLibEntry</strong> &lt;dir&gt; [&lt;dir&gt; ...]<br/>
        Adds one or more new entries which reference external source
        directories.
        <source>
          <![CDATA[
          <includepathentry kind="lib" path="/usr/local/php/cake_1.1.16.5421" createdReference="false" contentKind="source">
          </includepathentry>
          ]]>
        </source>
        This command supports command completion of directories.
      </li>
      <li>
        <anchor id="NewProjectEntry"/>
        <strong>:NewProjectEntry</strong> &lt;project&gt; [&lt;project&gt; ...]<br/>
        Adds one or more new entries which reference other projects.
        <source>
          <![CDATA[
          <includepathentry kind="prj" path="/test_php" resource="test_php" createdReference="true" contentKind="source">
          </includepathentry>
          ]]>
        </source>
        This command supports command completion of project names.
      </li>
      <li>
        <anchor id="NewVarEntry"/>
        <strong>:NewVarEntry</strong> &lt;VAR/file&gt; [&lt;VAR/file&gt; ...]<br/>
        Just like NewLibEntry except an Eclipse "var" entry is created.
        When adding references to external paths variables come in handy since
        other developers working with the project can specify where their
        version of the files are located.  This is especially useful if
        developers are working on different OSes where path locations will
        vary.<br/>
        The var entry allows you to define a base dir as a variable (ex.
        USER_HOME = /home/username), and then reference files relative to that
        variable.
        <source>
          <![CDATA[
          <includepathentry kind="var" path="CAKE" createdReference="false" contentKind="source">
          </includepathentry>
          ]]>
        </source>
        <p>
          To manage the include path variables, eclim provides the following
          commands.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <anchor id="VariableList"/>
            <strong>:VariableList</strong><br/>
            Lists all the currently available include path variables and their
            corresponding values.
          </li>
          <li>
            <anchor id="VariableCreate"/>
            <strong>:VariableCreate</strong> &lt;name&gt; &lt;path&gt;<br/>
            Creates or updates the variable with the supplied name.
          </li>
          <li>
            <anchor id="VariableDelete"/>
            <strong>:VariableDelete</strong> &lt;name&gt;<br/>
            Deletes the variable with the supplied name.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
