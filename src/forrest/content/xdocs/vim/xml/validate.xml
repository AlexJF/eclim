      When editing an xml file eclim will default to validating the file when it
      is written.  Any errors will be added to vim's quickfix window and their
      corresponding line number noted via vim's sign functionality.
    </p>
    <note>
      To prevent overwritting your quickfix buffer after a :make or :grep, eclim
      will only place the validation errors in the quickfix buffer if the buffer
      does not contain results from any user initiated quickfix commands (make,
      grep, vimgrep, etc.).
    </note>
    <p>
      If you don't want xml files validated when saving them, you can set the
      g:EclimXmlValidation variable described in the configuration section
      below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regardless of whether you have validation enabled upon saving or not, the
      following command is still available for validating xml files on demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>:Validation</strong> [&lt;file&gt;]<br/>
      Validate the supplied file or the current file if no file name provided.
      <br/>
      If eclimd is not currently running, and the xmllint command is available,
      eclim will validate the xml file using that.  Eclim will never use xmllint
      when saving the file with g:EclimXmlValidation enabled.
    </p>
    <p>
