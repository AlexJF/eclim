    <p>
      When editing xml files, eclim provides a couple commands which allow you
      to quickly and easily open the file's data definition and optionally jump
      to the definition of a particular element.
    </p>
    <note>
      When opening urls, these commands rely on netrw (:help netrw).
    </note>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <anchor id="DtdDefinition"/>
        <strong>:DtdDefinition</strong> [&lt;element&gt;]<br/>
        When invoked, this command will attempt to locate the dtd declaration in
        the current xml file and open the dtd in a new split window.  If you
        supply an element name when invoking the command, it will attempt to
        locate and jump to the definition of that element within the dtd.  If no
        element name is supplied, but the cursor is located on an element name
        when invoke, that element name will be used.
      </li>
      <li>
        <anchor id="XsdDefinition"/>
        <strong>:XsdDefinition</strong> [&lt;element&gt;]<br/>
        Behaves like <strong>:DtdDefinition</strong> except this command locates
        and opens the corresponding schema definition file.
      </li>
    </ul>
