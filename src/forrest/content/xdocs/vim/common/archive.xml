      Eclim includes a plugin which allows you to view the contents of archive
      files (jar, tar, tbz2, tgz, zip, and more).  Unlike the tar and zip
      plugins that ship with vim, the eclim version allows you to navigate the
      archive in a tree interface, and supports nested archives.

          When greater than 0, enables the eclim archive viewer (disabling the
          default vim tar and zip plugins).
