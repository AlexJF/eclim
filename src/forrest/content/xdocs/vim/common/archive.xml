    <p>
      Eclim includes a plugin which allows you to view the contents of archive
      files (jar, tar, tbz2, tgz, zip, and more).
    </p>
    <source>
      $ vim myarchive.tar.gz
    </source>
    <p>
      Unlike the tar and zip
      plugins that ship with vim, the eclim version gives you the option to view
      and navigate the archive in a tree or list interface, and supports nested
      archives.
    </p>
    <p>
      When viewing the archive you can switch layouts by using
      <strong>:AsList</strong> to switch from the tree layout to the list, and
      <strong>:AsTree</strong> to switch back.<br/>
      There are also various mappings depending on the view:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Tree</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong> - View the file under the cursor in a
            new split window, or in the case of a directory, expand / collapse
            it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>o</strong> - For files, this has the same behavior as
            <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>. For directories, it will fold /
            unfold open directories preserving the state of all the sub
            directories.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>p</strong> - Jumps to the nearest parent directory.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>P</strong> - Jumps to the furthest child in the currect
            branch of directories.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>List</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong> - View the file under the cursor in a
            new split window.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <section id="config">
      <title>Configuration</title>

        Vim Variables
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <anchor id="EclimArchiveViewerEnabled"/>
          <strong>g:EclimArchiveViewerEnabled</strong> (Default: 1)
          <br/>
          When greater than 0, enables the eclim archive viewer (disabling the
          default vim tar and zip plugins).
        </li>
        <li>
          <anchor id="EclimArchiveLayout"/>
          <strong>g:EclimArchiveLayout</strong> (Default: none)
          <br/>
          When non existant or equal to 'tree', displays the archive as a tree.
          When set to 'list', display the archive as a flat list.
        </li>
      </ul>
