    <p>
      <a href="site:trac">Trac</a> is a web based wiki and issue tracking
      software package that has quickly becoming a favorite amongst many open
      source projects. In addition to its wiki and ticketing sytem, it also
      includes a source code repository browser much like
      <a href="site:viewvc">ViewVc</a>.  As such, eclim supports several
      commands to quickly navigate to some of Trac's source code tools.
