      The following is a list of commands that may be execute when viewing a
      file versioned in either cvs or subversion.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <anchor id="VcsAnnotate"/>
        <strong>:VcsAnnotate</strong> -
        This command will run the corresponding 'cvs annotate' or 'svn blame'
        and annotate the current file via vim's sign support.  Due to vim
        limiting sign text to a maximum of two characters, the sign text will be
        the first two characters of the username.  This command will also remap
        'j' and 'k' so that the version number and author of the current line
        will be echoed to the status bar as you navigate the file.
      </li>
      <li>
        <anchor id="VcsAnnotateOff"/>
        <strong>:VcsAnnotateOff</strong> -
        Turns any current annotations off by removing all vim signs and removing
        'j' and 'k' mappings.
      </li>
    </ul>
