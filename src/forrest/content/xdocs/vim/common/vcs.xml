      The following is a list of commands that may be execute when viewing a
      file versioned in either cvs or subversion.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <anchor id="VcsAnnotate"/>
        <strong>:VcsAnnotate</strong> -
        This command will run the corresponding 'cvs annotate' or 'svn blame'
        and annotate the current file via vim's sign support.  Due to vim
        limiting sign text to a maximum of two characters, the sign text will be
        the first two characters of the username.  This command will also create
        a CursorHold event which will echo the version number and author of the
        current line.
      </li>
      <li>
        <anchor id="VcsAnnotateOff"/>
        <strong>:VcsAnnotateOff</strong> -
        Turns any current annotations off by removing all vim signs and
        disabling the CursorHold event.
      </li>
      <li>
        <anchor id="Viewvc"/>
        <strong>:Viewvc</strong> [file] -
        Opens the <a href="site:viewvc">ViewVc</a> url to the supplied file or
        directory, or to the current buffer if no argument supplied. Requires
        that the property 'org.eclim.project.vcs.viewvc' be set to the root url
        of your ViewVC instance such that any project relative path can be
        appended to it to render a valid url.<br/>
        Ex.
        <source>
          org.eclim.project.vcs.viewvc=http://eclim.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/eclim/
        </source>
      </li>
      <li>
        <anchor id="ViewvcAnnotate"/>
        <strong>:ViewvcAnnotate</strong> [revision] -
        Opens the <a href="site:viewvc">ViewVc</a> url for the current file in
        the annotation view for the last committed revision or the revision
        supplied.
      </li>
      <li>
        <anchor id="ViewvcChangeSet"/>
        <strong>:ViewvcChangeSet</strong> [revision] -
        Opens the <a href="site:viewvc">ViewVc</a> url for the change set of
        the last committed revision of the current file or the revision
        supplied.
      </li>
      <li>
        <anchor id="ViewvcDiff"/>
        <strong>:ViewvcDiff</strong> [revision, revision] -
        Opens the <a href="site:viewvc">ViewVc</a> url for the current file's
        revision diffed against the previous revision, the revision supplied,
        or a diff of the two revision numbers supplied.
