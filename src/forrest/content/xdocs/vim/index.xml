      As stated in the project description, eclim's main goal is to bring
      eclipse functionality to the vim editor.  Here you will find documentation
      on the fuctionality that eclim provides.

      You may use the navigation to the left to view configuration information
      (<a href="settings.html">settings</a>,
      <a href="mappings.html">suggested mappings</a>, etc.), or to navigate the
      functionality documentation which is broken up into categories (java, ant,
      etc.).
    </p>

      Before diving in, you should first familiarize yourself with the
      following commands.  After that, take a look at the docs for

      move onto the other categories.
