      <title>Shared functions</title>
      <p>
        The following set of functions are available to any plug-in that wishes
        to enhance the vim integration with eclim and Eclipse.  If you don't
        plan on added any new functionality, then you can safely skip this
        section.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          GetCurrentElementPosition()
          <p>
            Gets the current position of the element under the cursor for use
            with eclim. The result is in the form "offset;length" where the
            offset is the number of characters from the start of the file and
            the length is the length of the element.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          ExecuteEclim(args)
          <p>
            Executes the eclim client and returns the results.  The parameter
            "args" is expected to be a string with all the command line
            arguments to be passed to eclim.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>

          <p>
            Populates the quickfix window with the results in the file name
            supplied.  The results in the file are excepted to be in the form of
            "%f|%l col %c|%m".
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>%f: the filename</li>

            <li>%c: the column number</li>
            <li>%m: the message</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          PromptList(prompt, list, highlight)
          <p>
            Prompts the user to choose from the supplied list. "prompt" is the
            text used to explain to the user what they are choosing from.
            "list" is the list of elements to choose from. "highlight" is the
            highlight group to use for the prompt.  The result returned is the
            index in the list that the user chose.
