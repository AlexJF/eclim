    <p>
      As stated in the project description, eclim's main goal is to bring
      Eclipse functionality to the Vim editor.  Here you will find documentation
      on the functionality that eclim provides.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eclim documentation is broken up into two parts.  The first is the
      comprehensive documentation which details the usage and purpose of every
      command and setting.  This portion is found on the "Documentation" tab
      which you are currently on.  You may use the menu on this tab, which is
      located to the left, to navigate these docs.  Here you will find
      configuration information (<a href="settings.html">settings</a>,
      <a href="mappings.html">suggested mappings</a>, etc.), and the
      detailed functionality documentation which is broken up into categories
      (common functionality, java development functionality, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
      The second portion of the documentation consists of a set of guides which
      are written to help you perform specific tasks.  These guides are located
      on the <a href="../index.html">"Home" tab</a> under the "Guides" section
      of the left hand menu.  You may return to the "Home" tab at any time by
      simply clicking the corresponding tab located in the upper left.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before diving in, you should first familiarize yourself with the
      following commands.  After that, take a look at the docs for
      <a href="common/project.html">managing projects</a>.  Then feel free to
      move onto the other categories.
    </p>
