      <title>Requirements</title>
      <p>
        The Eclim plugins for vim require vim 7.  At the time of this writing,
        vim 7 is still alpha, but I have yet to encounter any major issues with
        it.  For information on obtaining and installing vim 7 please see the
        <a href="../install/index.html#vim_plugin">installation docs</a>.

      <title>Configuration</title>
      <p>
        Currently there are only a couple of global configuration settings
        available.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>g:EclimDebug</strong> (Default: 0)<br/>
          Setting this variable to 1 will turn on some simple debugging.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>g:EclimCommand</strong> (Default: "eclim")<br/>
          This variable is used to configure the command used for the eclim
          client.  Currently the only other alternative is "eclim-lite" which uses
          <a href="../install/index.html#nailgun">nailgun</a> to improve
          performance.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="global">
      <title>Global shared functions</title>
      <p>
        The following set of functions are available to any plug-in that wishes
        to enhance the vim integration with eclim and Eclipse.  If you don't
        plan on adding any new functionality, then you can safely skip this
        section.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>GetCurrentElementPosition()</strong><br/>
          Gets the current position of the element under the cursor for use
          with eclim. The result is in the form "offset;length" where the
          offset is the number of characters from the start of the file and
          the length is the length of the element.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>ExecuteEclim(args)</strong><br/>
          Executes the eclim client and returns the results.  The parameter
          "args" is expected to be a string with all the command line
          arguments to be passed to eclim.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>ParseQuickfixEntries(entries)</strong><br/>
          Parses the supplied list of quickfix entry lines (%f|%l col %c|%m) into a
          vim compatable list of dictionaries that can be passed to setqflist().
          <ul>
            <li>%f: the filename</li>
            <li>%l: the line number</li>
            <li>%c: the column number</li>
            <li>%m: the message</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>PromptList(prompt, list, highlight)</strong><br/>
          Prompts the user to choose from the supplied list. "prompt" is the
          text used to explain to the user what they are choosing from.
          "list" is the list of elements to choose from. "highlight" is the
          highlight group to use for the prompt.  The result returned is the
          index in the list that the user chose.
        </li>
      </ul>

        functionality.
