    <note>
      Python validation currently uses <a href="site:pyflakes">pyflakes</a> to
      perform the validation.  So in order to use eclim's python validation you
      will first need to install pyflakes and make sure it is in your path.
    </note>
    <p>
      When editing a python file eclim will default to validating the file when
      it is written.  Any errors will be added to the current window's location
      list (:help location-list) and their corresponding line number noted via
      Vim's sign functionality.
    </p>
    <note>
      Python validation does not currently require that the file exist in an
      Eclipse project, but this may change in the future.
    </note>
    <p>
      If you don't want python files validated when saving them, you can set the
      g:EclimPythonValidate variable described in the configuration section
      below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regardless of whether you have validation enabled upon saving or not, the
      following command is still available for validating xml files on demand.
    </p>
    <anchor id="Validate"/>
    <p>
      <strong>:Validate</strong><br/>
      Validate the current file.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Configuration</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Vim Variables
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <anchor id="EclimPythonValidate"/>
        <strong>g:EclimPythonValidate</strong><br/>
        If set to 0, disables python validation when saving the file.
      </li>
