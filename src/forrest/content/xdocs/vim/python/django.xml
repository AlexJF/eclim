      <title>Django manage.py</title>
      <p>
        For each project you create with the django framework, django provides
        you with a manage.py which can be used to perform various tasks.  To
        make the invocation of the manage.py script even easier, eclim provides
        the command <strong>:DjangoManage</strong> which can be invoked from any
        file in the same directory as your manage.py or in any of the child
        directories.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>:DjangoManage</strong> supports all the same commands as
        manage.py and supports command line completion of command names and app
        names where supported.
      </p>
      <p>
        Several of the manage.py commands simply perform an action without
        generating much if any output.  However there is also a set of commands
        which generate sql statements.  For all of these commands, instead of
        just running the command in a shell, <strong>:DjangoManage</strong> will
        run the command and populate a new buffer with the resulting output and
        set the proper file type.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="template">
      <title>Django html template support</title>
      <p><strong>Syntax</strong></p>
      <p>
        Vim ships with a syntax file for django html template files, but eclim
        builds on that base to support highlighting of user defined tags and
        filters.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Indent</strong></p>
      <p>
        Using the same settings as the enhanced syntax file, eclim also ships
        with an indent script which provides indentation support all of the
        default django tags and any user defined tags that have been configured.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Match It</strong></p>
      <p>
        Again, using the same set of variables, eclim set the necessary
        variables to allow proper matchit.vim support for django default and
        user defined tags.
