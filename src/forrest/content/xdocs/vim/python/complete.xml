    <p>
      Python code completion uses the standard
      <a href="../code_completion.html">Vim code completion mechanism</a> like
      so:
    </p>
    <source>
      mylist = [1, 2, 3]
      mylist.ind&lt;Ctrl-X&gt;&lt;Ctrl-U&gt;
      mylist.index(
    </source>
    <note>
      Due to the dynamic typing nature of python, the code completion leaves
      something to be desired.  It will not be able to complete nearly as much
      as could be completed in a static typed language, like java, but can
      still be a helpful tool.<br/><br/>
      Also note that vim ships with a pretty good python code completion plugin
      as well, but the pydev backed implementation in eclim seems to be able to
      provide some code completion suggestions that the vim alternative cannot.
