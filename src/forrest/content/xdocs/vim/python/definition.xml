    <p>
      Backed by the <a href="site:pydev">PyDev plugin</a>, eclim supports the
      ability to jump to the definition of a class, method, function, or
      variable using the command <strong>:PythonFindDefinition</strong>.
    </p>
    <note>
      PyDev has a few limitations on what it can find, but for the most part
      works very well.
      The <a href="http://www.fabioz.com/pydev/">PyDev Extensions</a> is suppose
      to not have these limitations.  Eclim may integrate with this enhanced
      version at a later date.
