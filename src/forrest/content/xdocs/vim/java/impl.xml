    <title>Method Override / Impl</title>

      This functionality gives you the ability to view all the methods that
      the current source file can implement or override according to what
      interfaces it implements and classes it extends.  From the list of methods
      you can then choose which you want to implement or override, and the
      appropriate method stub will be inserted into the file.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first step in the process is to execute <strong>:JavaImpl</strong>
      which will open a vim window containing a list possible methods to
      implement / override and the interface / class which defines those
      methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is some example content from a class that extends
      java.io.InputStream:
    </p>
    <source>
      com.test.TestStream

      package java.io;
      public class InputStream
        public int read ()
          throws IOException
        public int read (byte[] b)
          throws IOException
        public int read (byte[] b, int off, int len)
          throws IOException
        public long skip (long n)
          throws IOException
        public int available ()
          throws IOException
        public void close ()
          throws IOException
        public void mark (int readlimit)
        public void reset ()
          throws IOException
        public boolean markSupported ()

      package java.io;
      public interface Closeable
        public void close ()
          throws IOException

      package java.lang;
      public class Object
        public int hashCode ()
        public boolean equals (Object obj)
        protected Object clone ()
          throws CloneNotSupportedException
        public String toString ()
        protected void finalize ()
          throws Throwable
    </source>
    <p>
      From the newly opened window you can select a method to generate a stub
      for by simply hitting &lt;Enter&gt; with the cursor over the method
      signature.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you would like to generate stubs for all methods in an interface or
      class, in the same window, simply hit &lt;Enter&gt; with the cursor over
      the class name.
    </p>
    <note>
      The insertion of method stubs is done externally with eclipse and with
      that comes a couple <a href="../external_editing.html">caveats</a>.
    </note>
    <p>
      This functionality is currently supported for both outer and inner
      classes, but not for anonymous inner classes.  To view the list of
      methods to override for an inner class, simply execute
      <strong>:JavaImpl</strong> with the cursor somewhere in the inner class.
