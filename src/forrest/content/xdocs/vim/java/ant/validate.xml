      When editing an ant xml file eclim will default to validating the file
      when it is written.  Any errors will be added to the current window's
      location list (:help location-list) and their corresponding line number
      noted via Vim's sign functionality.
    </p>
    <note>
      Ant file validation does not require that the file exist in an Eclipse
      project, but this may change in the future.
    </note>
    <p>
      Currently the Eclipse ant file validation isn't as robust as one might
      hope.  It doesn't validate that element attributes are correct, that child
      elements are valid, etc., but it does perform the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If a default target is specified, validate that it exists and that the
        target dependencies exist.
      </li>
      <li>
        Check for missing dependencies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Check for circular dependencies.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Eclim also combines the above validation with
      <a href="../../xml/validate.html">xml validation</a> to validate
      that the ant file is well formed.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you do not want your ant files validated automatically when saved, you
      can set the
      <a href="#EclimAntValidate">g:EclimAntValidate</a> variable described in
      the configuration section
      below.
    </p>
    <anchor id="Validate"/>
    <p>
      Whether or not auto validation has been enabled, eclim also exposes
      the following command for manually executing the validation of the ant
      file:<br/>
      <strong>:Validate</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Configuration</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Vim Variables
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <anchor id="EclimAntValidate"/>
        <strong>g:EclimAntValidate</strong> (Default: 1)<br/>
        If set to 0, disables ant xml validation when saving the file.
      </li>
    </ul>
