    <p>
      When editing an ant build file eclim defines a command named
      <strong>:AntDoc</strong> which will attempt to lookup and open in your
      <a href="../../index.html#EclimBrowser">configured browser</a> the
      documentation for the element under the cursor or, if supplied, the
      element passed to it.<br/>
      This command will only lookup element names, not attribute names or
      values.
    </p>
    <p>
      By default this plugin is configured to find all the standard ant tasks,
      types, etc, as well as those defined by the
      <a href="ext:antcontrib">antcontrib project</a>.
    </p>
    <anchor id="AntUserDoc"/>
    <p>
      If you have other tasks that you wish to add to this plugin, you can do so
      by defining the global variable <strong>g:AntUserDocs</strong>.  The value
      of this variable is expected to be a map of element names to the url where
      the documentation for that element can be found.  The url also supports a
      substitution variable, &lt;element&gt; which will be substituted with the
      lower case version of the element name.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following is an example which adds the tasks from the apache cactus
      project.
