    <note>
      Ant code completion does not require that the file exist in an Eclipse
      project, but this may change in the future.
    </note>
    <p>
      Ant code completion uses the standard
      <a href="../../code_completion.html">Vim code completion mechanism</a> like
      so:
    </p>
    <source>
      <![CDATA[
      <ja<Ctrl-X><Ctrl-U>
      <jar de<Ctrl-X><Ctrl-U>
      <jar destfile="${bas<Ctrl-X><Ctrl-U>
      <jar destfile="${basdir
      ...
      ]]>
    </source>
    <p>
      Screenshot of completion in action:

          alt="Ant Completion"/>
    </p>
    <warning>
      If your ant file has a lot of imports, then the code completion may be
      slow as Eclipse parses all the imports when creating the ant model.  You
      will notice the same slow behavior when using Eclipse directly.
