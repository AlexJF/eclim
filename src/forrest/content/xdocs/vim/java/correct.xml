    <title>Java Code Correction</title>

    <p>
      Code correction in eclim is equivalent to the quick fix functionality of
      eclipse.  When you save a java source file, eclim
      <a href="source.html">validates</a> the file and notes which lines contain
      errors.  To have eclim suggest possible corrections for an error, you
      simply place the cursor on the error line and issue
      <strong>:JavaCorrect</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result will be a small window opened at the bottom of vim where any
      correction proposals will be noted.  To apply a suggested change, simply
      move the cursor to the line describing the modification and hit
      &lt;Enter&gt;.  Upon doing so, the change will be applied to the source
      file.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example output of <strong>:JavaCorrect</strong>.
    </p>
    <source>
      The serializable class Foo does not declare a static final serialVersionUID field of type long
      0.1227:  Add @SuppressWarnings 'serial' to 'Foo'
        ...
        @SuppressWarnings("serial")
        public class Foo
        implements Serializable
      ...
    </source>
    <p>
      To apply the above change you would hit &lt;Enter&gt; on the line:
    </p>
    <source>
      0.1227:  Add @SuppressWarnings 'serial' to 'Foo'
    </source>
    <note>
      The code correction is done externally with eclipse and with that comes a
      couple <a href="../external_editing.html">caveats</a>.
