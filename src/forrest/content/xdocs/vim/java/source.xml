    <p>
      When saving a java source file that resides in a project, eclim will
      update that source file in eclipse and will report any validation errors
      found.  Any errors will be placed in the current window's location list
      (:help location-list) and the corresponding lines in the source file will
      be marked via vim's :sign functionality with '>>' markers in the left
      margin.
    </p>
