    <p>
      When saving a java source file that resides in a project, eclim will
      update that source file in eclipse and will report any validation errors
      found.  Any errors will be placed in vim's quickfix buffer and the
      corresponding lines in the source file will be marked via vim's :sign
      functionality.
