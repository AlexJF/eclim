    <p>
      Eclim provides a means to test java regular expressions.  Simply execute
      <strong>:JavaRegex</strong> and a vim window will open allowing you to
      test your regular expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      By default the content of the regex window will be:
    </p>
    <source>
      test

      Some test content to test
      a java regex against.
    </source>
    <p>
      The first line of this window is the regular expression to test, and the
      remaining lines consist of the content to test against.  When you write
      the file (:w), eclim will evaluate the regular expression and highlight
      all matched occurrences as well as any groups found within those
      occurrences.
    </p>
    <p>
      By default eclim uses four different highlighting groups,
      two which are alternated between for the full matches, and two that are
      alternated between for the group matches.  Eclim alternates the
      highlighting so that you can distinguish one match from the next even if
      they occur one right after the other.  Before utilizing the regex testing,
      you should first modify the four variables defined below which define what
      highlighting groups will be used.  Since color schemes can vary greatly,
      eclim defaults to using some common groups already defined by vim.
    </p>
    <p>
      The regex window also provides two commands to jump to the next or
      previous match much like 'n' or 'N' for vim searching:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <anchor id="NextMatch"/>
        <strong>:NextMatch</strong> - Jump to the next match.
      </li>
      <li>
        <anchor id="PreMatch"/>
        <strong>:PrevMatch</strong> - Jump to the previous match.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Configuration</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Vim Variables:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <anchor id="EclimRegexHi_0"/>
        <strong>g:EclimRegexHi{0}</strong> (Default: 'Constant')<br/>
        The first highlighting group used for full regex matches.
      </li>
      <li>
        <anchor id="EclimRegexHi_1"/>
        <strong>g:EclimRegexHi{1}</strong> (Default: 'MoreMsg')<br/>
        The second highlighting group used for full regex matches.
      </li>
      <li>
        <anchor id="EclimRegexGroupHi_0"/>
        <strong>g:EclimRegexGroupHi{0}</strong> (Default: 'Statement')<br/>
        The first highlighting group used for group matches.
      </li>
      <li>
        <anchor id="EclimRegexGroupHi_1"/>
        <strong>g:EclimRegexGroupHi{1}</strong> (Default: 'Todo')<br/>
        The second highlighting group used for group matches.
      </li>
    </ul>
