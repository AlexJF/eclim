    <p>
      While editing a java source file, if you start to create a logging
      statement (<code>log.</code>), the logging plugin will attempt to perform
      the appropriate initialization (imports, static variable) for the
      configured logging implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Configuration</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        g:EclimLoggingDisabled
        <p>
          If set to a value greater than 0, then this plugin will be disabled.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        g:EclimLoggingImpl
        <p>
          Determines which logging implementation to use.<br/>
          Possible values include "commons-logging", "slf4j", "log4j", and
          "jdk".<br/>
          Defaults to "commons-logging" as both the commons-logging impl and the
          slf4j replacement can be used.
