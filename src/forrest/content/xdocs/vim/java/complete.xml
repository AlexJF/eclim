      The java code completion makes use of the new "User Defined Completion"
      added to vim 7.
    </p>
    <p>
      To use the code completion use Ctrl-X Ctrl-U while in insert mode at the
      position you wish to start the completion from.<br/>
    </p>
    <source>
      System.o&lt;Ctrl-X&gt;&lt;Ctrl-U&gt;
      System.out.pri&lt;Ctrl-X&gt;&lt;Ctrl-U&gt;
    </source>
    <p>
      Once you have started the completion you can use Ctrl-N to procede to the
      next match and Ctrl-P for the previous match.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are like me and you find those key strokes a bit cumbersome, then
      you can use the excellent <a href="ext:supertab">SuperTab</a> plugin which
      allows you to use the Tab key for completion.  However at this time
      SuperTab does not support the latest completion modes for vim 7, so I have
      patched it to add the necessary support.  You can download the updated
      version in the <a href="ext:supertab_patch">downloads</a> area.
    </p>
    <p>
      To find out more about vim's insert completion use<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;:h ins-completion<br/>
      from within vim.
