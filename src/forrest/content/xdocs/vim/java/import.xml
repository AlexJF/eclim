    <title>Automated Imports</title>
  </header>
  <body>
    <p>
      The automated import functionality is pretty straightforward.  Simply
      place the cursor over the element to import and issue the command<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;:JavaImport<br/>
      and one of the following events will occur:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If only one matching element is found its import statement will be
        placed in the file.
      </li>
      <li>
        If multiple matching elements are found, you will be prompted to choose
        the element you wish to import from a list.
      </li>
      <li>
        If an element with the same name is already imported, the element is in
        java.lang, or the element is in the same package as the current src
        file, then a simple prompt will alert you that the element does not need
        to be imported.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In addition to importing elements, the plugin provides two additional
      commands:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        :JavaImportSort
        <p>
          Sorts the import statements in alphabetical order with java and javax
          imports first.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        :JavaImportClean
        <p>
          Removes any un-used import statements.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </body>
