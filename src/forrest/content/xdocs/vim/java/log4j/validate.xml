    <p>
      When editing a log4j xml file eclim will default to validating the file
      when it is written.  Any errors will be added to the current window's
      location list (:help location-list) and their corresponding line number
      noted via Vim's sign functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eclim also combines the above validation with
      <a href="../../xml/validate.html">xml validation</a> to validate
      that the file is well formed.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you do not want your log4j files validated automatically when saved, you
      can set the
      <a href="#EclimLog4jValidate">g:EclimLog4jValidate</a> variable described in
      the configuration section below.
    </p>
    <anchor id="Validate"/>
    <p>
      Whether or not auto validation has been enabled, eclim also exposes the
      following command for manually executing the validation of the file:<br/>
      <strong>:Validate</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Configuration</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Vim Variables
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <anchor id="EclimLog4jValidate"/>
        <strong>g:EclimLog4jValidate</strong> (Default: 1)<br/>
        If set to 0, disables validation when saving the file.
      </li>
    </ul>
