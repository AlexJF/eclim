    <p>
      As of Java 1.5 (Java 5.0), the sun jdk started shipping with some useful
      tools for viewing information about running java processes.  To provide
      quick and easy access to some of the information these commands provide,
      eclim exposes the command <strong>:Jps</strong>.
    </p>
    <note>
      For more information on the jdk tools you may view the
      <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/index.html#manage">
        online documentation
      </a>.
    </note>
    <p>
      When invoked it will open a window containing information about the
      current processes and some links for viewing additional info (depending
      upon availability of required tools on your platform).
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Line 1 consists of the process id followed by either the class name
        the process was started with or the path to the jar file.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lines 2 - 4 contains links that when you hit &lt;Enter&gt; on, will open
        another window displaying the requested additional info.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lines 6 - 31 is a folded block which contains a list of all the
        arguments passed to the main method of the process.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lines 33 - 35 is a folded block which contains a list of all the
        arguments passed to the JVM.
