    <p>
      To facilitate quick access of Vim help for elements of a Vim script, eclim
      provides the command <strong>:VimDoc</strong>.  When executed it will open
      the help docs for the supplied argument or for the element under the
      cursor.  When mapped to a key binding of your choosing, this command can
      save you some repetitive typing and provides an internal map of some
      keywords to their help topic, which are not always as straight forward as
      :help word.
    </p>
    <note>
      If you come across any instances where this command does not find the
      expected Vim help topic, please report it so that it may be accounted for
      in future revisions.
