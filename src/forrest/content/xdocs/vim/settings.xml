    <p>
      Certain aspects of eclim can be controlled by modifying one or more
      settings.<br/>
      There are two types of settings available:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Eclim global / project settings.</strong><br/>
        These are settings that reside in your Eclipse workspace and are used to
        control certain aspects of the eclim server's behavior.  These settings
        can be viewed and modified using one of the following commands:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="index.html#commands"><strong>:EclimSettings</strong></a>
            <br/>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="common/project.html"><strong>:ProjectSettings</strong></a>
            <br/>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Vim global variable settings.</strong><br/>
        These are your typical global Vim variables which can be set within your
        vimrc file.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Givin these two types, you may be ask, why do we need two? Or, when a new
      setting is added, how do you decide which type to make it?
    </p>
    <p>
      The reasoning behind having two types is that there are some settings that
      may vary from one project to another.  For instance, I may have one
      project that can be used in jdk 1.3 and utilizes log4j for logging, while
      another project of mine requires jdk 1.4 and utilizes slf4j for logging.
      Instances like this require that each project be capable of storing their
      own settings.  Rather than reinvent this support in Vim, we utilize
      Eclipse's built in preferences system.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Eclipse preferences system can store project level and global
      settings, why not make all the eclim settings of this type?  Well, the
      downside to Eclipse preferences system is that an Eclipse instance must be
      running to obtain the value of that preference.  Eclim however, requires
      access to many settings, regardless of whether Eclipse is running or not.
      So, to ensure that these settings are always available, we utilize the
      standard Vim global variable support.
    </p>
    <p>
      When adding a new setting, deciding between an Eclipse preference or a Vim
      global variable is a matter of answering the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Will this setting vary from one project to another?<br/>
        Yes: Add this setting an Eclipse preference.
      </li>
      <li>
        Does eclim need access to this setting regardless of whether an Eclipse
        instance is running or not?<br/>
        Yes: Add this setting a Vim global variable.
      </li>
    </ul>

      <title>Eclim global / project settings</title>
      <p>
        The following is a list of the common global / project settings
        available.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <anchor id="org.eclim.user.name"/>
          <strong>org.eclim.user.name</strong><br/>
          Should be set to your name. Used by various commands that add contact or
          author information to a file.
        </li>
        <li>
          <anchor id="org.eclim.user.email"/>
          <strong>org.eclim.user.email</strong><br/>
          Should be set to the email address where you can be contacted.  Used by
          various commands that add contact or author information to a file.
        </li>
        <li>
          <anchor id="org.eclim.project.version"/>
          <strong>org.eclim.project.version</strong><br/>
          Should be set to the version number of your project.  This is used by
          various commands that add version info to a file or utilize the
          version number in some other manner.
          <br/>Defaults to "1.0".
        </li>
      </ul>

    <section id="vim_settings">
      <title>Vim global variables</title>
      <p>
        The following is a list of global Vim variables available.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <anchor id="EclimLogLevel"/>
          <strong>g:EclimLogLevel</strong> (Default: 5)<br/>
          Much like the Vim 'verbose' option, this variable allows you to
          control the level of output from eclim as follows:
          <ul>
            <li>&lt;= 0: No output.</li>
            <li>&gt;= 1: Fatal errors.</li>
            <li>&gt;= 2: Errors.</li>
            <li>&gt;= 3: Warning messages.</li>
            <li>&gt;= 4: Info messages.</li>
            <li>&gt;= 5: Debug messages.</li>
            <li>&gt;= 6: Trace messages.</li>
          </ul>
          Each level also has a corresponding variable to set the highlighting
          group used for the text.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <anchor id="EclimFatalHighlight"/>
              <strong>g:EclimFatalHighlight</strong> (Default: "Error")
            </li>
            <li>
              <anchor id="EclimErrorHighlight"/>
              <strong>g:EclimErrorHighlight</strong> (Default: "Error")
            </li>
            <li>
              <anchor id="EclimWarningHighlight"/>
              <strong>g:EclimWarningHighlight</strong> (Default: "WarningMsg")
            </li>
            <li>
              <anchor id="EclimInfoHighlight"/>
              <strong>g:EclimInfoHighlight</strong> (Default: "Statement")
            </li>
            <li>
              <anchor id="EclimDebugHighlight"/>
              <strong>g:EclimDebugHighlight</strong> (Default: "Normal")
            </li>
            <li>
              <anchor id="EclimTraceHighlight"/>
              <strong>g:EclimTraceHighlight</strong> (Default: "Normal")
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <anchor id="EclimSignLevel"/>
          <strong>g:EclimSignLevel</strong> (Default: 5)<br/>
          Behaves just like <strong>g:EclimLogLevel</strong> except this applies
          to placing of Vim signs for displaying validation errors / warnings,
          or marking :[vim]grep matches.<br/>
          The resulting signs also use the same highlighting variables above.
        </li>
        <li>
          <anchor id="EclimEchoHighlight"/>
          <strong>g:EclimEchoHighlight</strong> (Default: "Statement")<br/>
          Determines which highlight group will be used for informative
          messages.
        </li>
        <li>
          <anchor id="EclimBrowser"/>
          <strong>g:EclimBrowser</strong> (Default: Dependent on OS)<br/>
          Configures the external web browser to use when opening urls.<br/>
          By default eclim will attempt to set a default browser based on your
          system, but if it cannot find a compatible browser, you will need to
          set one in your vimrc.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Firefox<br/>let g:EclimBrowser = 'firefox'
            </li>
            <li>
              Mozilla<br/>let g:EclimBrowser = 'mozilla'
            </li>
            <li>
              Opera<br/>let g:EclimBrowser = 'opera'
            </li>
            <li>
              IE<br/>let g:EclimBrowser = 'iexplore'
            </li>
          </ul>
          Note: The above examples assume that the browser executable is in your
          path. On windows machines they won't be by default, so you will need
          to add them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <anchor id="EclimShowCurrentError"/>
          <strong>g:EclimShowCurrentError</strong> (Default: 1)<br/>
          This variable determines whether or not a CursorHold autocommand is
          created that will echo the error associated with the current line if
          any error exists.  Setting this variable to 0 disables this feature.
        </li>
        <li>
          <anchor id="EclimMakeLCD"/>
          <strong>g:EclimMakeLCD</strong> (Default: 1)<br/>
          When not set to 0, this enables autocommand which will perform a local
          change directory (:lcd) for the current window, setting that window's
          current working directory to the directory of the current file.  After
          execution of the :make command, that window's current working
          directory will be restored to the dir it was prior to executing
          :make.<br/>
          Enabling this has the benefit of allowing you to run :make or
          <a href="java/ant/run.html"><strong>:Ant</strong></a> from any file
          regardless of where it was opened from without having to worry about
          the directory it is executing from.  For example if you have a file
          open from project A and split a file from project B, you can execute
          <strong>:Ant</strong> from the project B file and it will utilize
          project B's build.xml even though your current working directory is in
          project A.
        </li>
