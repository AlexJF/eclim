These are just some random notes for myself that don't need to be in the docs.

Minimum execution of vim w/ eclim support
  echo -c "set nocompatible\nsyntax on\nfiletype plugin on" > _vimrc.minimum
  vim -u _vimrc.minimum
  gvim -u _vimrc.minimum -U none

Helpful link for debugging plugin errors.

Java 1.4 support
  Jars only need to support 1.4
    jaxen, xerces, xml-apis

Core Tools (plugin with tools for debugging / fixing issues)

  - Workspace Re-Builder (looks a bit old, may need some work).

When using a project created from eclipse, may get errors in log when saving +
closing a src file, complaining that the .swp file doesn't exist.  To fix this,
you need to exclude the swp files from the eclipse build.

  Project > Properties > Java Build Path
    Expand Source folder node
    Select "Excluded"
    Hit "Edit"
    Add exclusion pattern: **/*.swp
Or
  Edit .classpath
    Add attribute to src classpathentry
      excluding="**/*.swp"
    You can use '|' to delineate multiple entries
      excluding="**/*.swp|**/*.tmp"
