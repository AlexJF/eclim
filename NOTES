These are just some random notes for myself that don't need to be in the docs.

  Steps for new releases:
    1) tag cvs (cvs tag -R Release_1_2_0)
    2) create sourceforge release
    3) update documentation website
    4) announce on freshmeat

  Minimum execution of vim w/ eclim support
    echo -c "set nocompatible\nsyntax on\nfiletype plugin on" > _vimrc.minimum
    vim -u _vimrc.minimum
    gvim -u _vimrc.minimum -U none

  Helpful link for debugging plugin errors.
    http://eclipse.org/eclipse/platform-core/documents/3.1/debug.html

  Java 1.4 support
    Jars only need to support 1.4
      jaxen, xerces, xml-apis

  Core Tools (plugin with tools for debugging / fixing issues)
    http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/platform-core/downloads.html (Spies/Tools)
    - Workspace Re-Builder (looks a bit old, may need some work).

  When using a project created from eclipse, may get errors in log when saving +
  closing a src file, complaining that the .swp file doesn't exist.  To fix this,
  you need to exclude the swp files from the eclipse build.

    Project > Properties > Java Build Path
      Expand Source folder node
      Select "Excluded"
      Hit "Edit"
      Add exclusion pattern: **/*.swp
  Or
    Edit .classpath
      Add attribute to src classpathentry
        excluding="**/*.swp"
      You can use '|' to delineate multiple entries
        excluding="**/*.swp|**/*.tmp"

Trivial memory benchmark of vanilla eclipse vs eclim headless eclipse.
1) start the application
2) open and save org.eclim.Service
2) open and save build.xml
