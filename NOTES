These are just some random notes for myself that don't need to be in the docs.

Minimum execution of vim w/ eclim support
  echo -c "set nocompatible\nsyntax on\nfiletype plugin on" > _vimrc.minimum

  vim -u _vimrc.minimum
  gvim -u _vimrc.minimum -U none

Helpful link for debugging plugin errors.
  http://eclipse.org/eclipse/platform-core/documents/3.1/debug.html

Java 1.4 support
  Jars only need to support 1.4
    jaxen, xerces, xml-apis

Core Tools (plugin with tools for debugging / fixing issues)
  http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/platform-core/downloads.html (Spies/Tools)
  - Workspace Re-Builder (looks a bit old, may need some work).
