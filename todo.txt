      resolved at install time via a visual diff.

Documentation

  - FAQs
    - how to specify workspace dir.
      eclimd -Dosgi.instance.area.default=@user.home/another_workspace
  - document python import functionality
  - added -n doc to project creation docs.

    every element since they are "not declared" (ex. ant/cvs.xml).

Windows Bugs

Eclipse 3.3
  - code completion for eclipse plugin.xml and MANIFEST.MF

Enhancements
  - sgml style files... on </ try to complete proper close tag.
  - javascript doc lookup for common libraries
    - yui
    - prototype
    - jquery
    ...

  - create :ProjectImport <dir> command
    - Eclipse equivalant:
      File > Import... > General > Existing Projects Into Workspace

  - modify :DjangoFind to account for django provided tags and filters.

  - look into platform based releases on sourceforge:
    http://sourceforge.net/features/platformpages.php

  - determines the user's default workspace using
    eclipse/configuration/.settings/org.eclipse.ui.ide.prefs
    RECENT_WORKSPACES=/home/ervandew/test_workspace,/home/ervandew/workspace

  - :ProjectGrep support project relative file completion
  - :MinimizeWindows, map <space>hjkl to move to next un-minimized window in
    that direction, or stay in current window if none.
    OR, map that to something else and use <space>hjkl to grow or shrink the
    current window.
    On minimize, execute winc = ?
    - bug, maybe cause of my new taglist, when minimizing 2 of 4 python files,
      focus ends up in the taglist window.

  - :ProjectTodo run vimgrep against all files using user defined pattern...
    by default '\(\<fixme\>\|\<todo\>\)\c'
    - create list of file extensions to search
    - lvimgrep first item and lvimgrep add the rest
    - don't jump to first file, just open location list window.
  - :Todo run vimgrep on current file using user defined pattern.

  - for taglist, support universal marker tag:
    |-- marker_name --|

  - JUnit results in the browser.
  - Integrate with eclipse junit execution env and provide user with option to
    choice which to use (eclipse or current external version).
    org.eclim.java.junit.engine=(eclipse|external)

  - Integrate w/ google calendar
    http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/client-java.html

  - Add support for using a running eclipse gui as the eclimd server.
    - add a menu item which starts up nailgun and spring.
      - ping first to see if one is running.
    - combine w/ vimplugin to allow vim in eclipse w/ eclipse funtionality.

  - In addition to marking lines w/ errors/warnings, highlight the offending text.
  - CursorHold validation of files.
    - via temp file?

  - :JavaImpl support anonymous classes.
  - add ProjectImport dir
    - Given a directory, search for all .project files and create projects
      for their corresponding parent directory (be sure to read the project
      name from the file as it may not follow the eclim naming standard).
    - If no dir supplied use workspace dir?
  - implement means to highlight text and push it to the command prompt
    Ctrl-: or something similar.

  - For commands that spawn temp buffer, assign a b:currentfile var to the
    file that opened the buffer so that other commands can still be invoked
    by changing the get file name function to examine b:currentfile.
    - JavaImpl, JavaDelegate, JUnitImpl, JUnitResult
  - for temp buffers containing java code (JavaImpl, class prototypes, etc.)
    set a variable to mainain the name of the current project, and add a way to
    force element based searches to become keyword based.

  - add :JavaBeanImpl for defining an implementation of a bean interface.
  - automate switch statement generation for enums.
    When switch(enum), create cases for all enum values.
  - :JavaImpl, wrap long parameter lines.
  - modify for loop abbreviations to increment the looping var if the current
    one is taken.  (ii, jj, kk, ll, mm, nn, ...)
  - create a groovy templating harness
    - create utility class with methods such as
      - createMethod (velocity_template, values)
      - createField (velocity_template, values)
      - createImport (velocity_template, values)
      - createClass (velocity_template, values)
      - createCode (velocity_template, values) - insert code at current
        cursor position
    - standard templates
      - jakarta equals, hashCode, toString.
      - logging
  - push method to interface... create method in interface from method in
    implementation.
  - With :JavaRun, also have an input buffer that when saved pushes the text
    to stdin of the running app, and then clears the buffer for more input.
  - java version of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=165 ?

  - get working under cygwin
    if has('win32unix')
    - eclim command
    - file paths
    - search results
  - fedora + eclipse + gcj/gnu classpath
    - http://www.fedoraproject.org/wiki/Eclipse
    - http://sourceware.org/eclipse/
  - integrate w/ http://www.easyeclipse.org/site/home/
