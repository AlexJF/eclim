Installer
  - help alleviate need for users to set ECLIPSE_HOME.
    - inject path into one of the vim scripts and allow override with
      ECLIPSE_HOME
    - on Windows, just set the ECLIPSE_HOME for the user if not already set.
  - when deciding where to install vim plugins, run vim to determine its
    runtime path dirs and give the user the option to install into one that
    they have write permissions to.
  - maintain a version database for resources directories so we can determine
    what files were added or modified by the user.
    - keep an md5sum of each file to determine user changes which can be
      resolved at install time via a visual diff.

Bugs
  - xml validate, if a doctype exists, but no dtd, then there is an error for
    every element since they are "not declared" (ex. ant/cvs.xml).
  - possible issues with eclipse and symlinks
  - sometimes when warning and error are on the same line+col, the mark
    shows error, but the cursor hold text shows the warning message.
  - on JavaSearch for implementors, exclude the javadoc matches.
  - issues working with
    http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=69 ?
    According to http://tompurl.com/index.php/2006/06/27/eclim-vim-eclipse/
    line 1244: Change from:
      if !exists(':Project')
    to
      if exists(':Project') != 2
    Waiting for confirmation that this is the only error.

Enhancements
  - Wiki site.
    http://www.pmwiki.org/
  - Add support for using a running eclipse gui as the eclimd server.
    - add a menu item which starts up nailgun and spring.
    - combine w/ vimplugin to allow vim in eclipse w/ eclipse funtionality.
  - add :DtdDoc command that opens the current xml file's dtd and jumps to
    the element under the cursor.
  - add :SchemaDoc command that opens the current xml file's schema and jumps to
    the element under the cursor.
  - :JavaImpl support anonymous classes.
  - add ProjectImport dir
    - Given a directory, search for all .project files and create projects
      for their corresponding parent directory (be sure to read the project
      name from the file as it may not follow the eclim naming standard).
    - If no dir supplied use workspace dir?
  - get working under cygwin
    if has('win32unix')
    - eclim command
    - file paths
    - search results
  - implement means to highlight text and push it to the command prompt
    Ctrl-: or something similar.
  - For commands that spawn temp buffer, assign a b:currentfile var to the
    file that opened the buffer so that other commands can still be invoked
    by changing the get file name function to examine b:currentfile.
    - JavaImpl, JavaDelegate, JUnitImpl, JUnitResult
  - integrate w/ http://www.easyeclipse.org/site/home/
  - add :JavaBeanImpl for defining an implementation of a bean interface.
  - automate switch statement generation for enums.
    When switch(enum), create cases for all enum values.
  - :JavaImpl, wrap long parameter lines.
  - modify for loop abbreviations to increment the looping var if the current
    one is taken.  (ii, jj, kk, ll, mm, nn, ...)
  - create a groovy templating harness
    - create utility class with methods such as
      - createMethod (velocity_template, values)
      - createField (velocity_template, values)
      - createImport (velocity_template, values)
      - createClass (velocity_template, values)
      - createCode (velocity_template, values) - insert code at current
        cursor position
    - standard templates
      - jakarta equals, hashCode, toString.
      - logging
  - push method to interface... create method in interface from method in
    implementation.
  - With :JavaRun, also have an input buffer that when saved pushes the text
    to stdin of the running app, and then clears the buffer for more input.
  - allow re-formatting of xml section that can take an xml file and break up
    the elements into lines accordingly.
      <blah><duh>somevalue</duh></blah>
    becomes
      <blah>
        <duh>somevalue</duh>
      </blah>
  - java version of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=165 ?

JTest support:
  - settings
    dict {
      name
      src dir
      output dir
      command
    }

  - {'name': 'junit', 'src_dir': , 'output_dir': , 'command': }
  - {'name': 'cactus', 'src_dir': , 'output_dir': , 'command': }
  - {'name': 'testng', 'src_dir': , 'output_dir': , 'command': }

Other
  - add ant-contrib to ant syntax file.
  - fix java indent
    - Indents after a annotation
        @Override
          public boolean equals (Object _other)
    - doesn't handle indentation of enums
        public enum MyEnum
        {
          FIRST,
            SECOND,
            THIRD
        }
    - Indents inner class declaration differently than outer
        public class Blah
          extends Foo
        {
          public class Bar
              extends Baz
            {
            }
        }
    - reformatting class declaration doesn't perform proper indent of { when
      put on a new line (and an = call does not fix it).
        public class Blah extends Foo {
        }
        public class Blah
          extends Foo
          {
        }
    - does not indent { on a new line when used for arrays
        public static String[] STRINGS =
        {"one", "two", "three"};
    - anonymous inner class flaky at times.

Vim Suggestions
  - Set syntax on a region?
    Useful for help files, or any other text file containing mix of text and
    code.
    Ex.
      let blah = 'duh'
      unlet blah
  - :tcd  tab local change directory (like lcd, but for all windows in current tab).
